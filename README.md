## Android Kanji Fix

An application to fix Japanese glyph rendering in Android 4.1 and up. [This thread on XDA](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1901424) describes the issue and possible fixes. **Root access is required!**

In short, Android will render Chinese glyphs by default when the system language is set to anything but Japanese. By changing the default ordering of fonts, this app indicates Android should prioritize Japanese Kanji.

More information about what this application does can be found in the wiki.
